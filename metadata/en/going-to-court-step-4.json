  "body": "At the first hearing the court will see if there’s still a chance you can reach an agreement with the other parent.\r\n\r\n### If you can reach an agreement\r\n\r\nThe judge will end the process and write a consent order setting out the details of your agreement.\r\n\r\n### If you can’t reach an agreement\r\n\r\nThe judge will look at the issues you disagree on and set out a timetable for what will happen next.\r\n\r\nYou may be asked to try and reach an agreement again. This could be through [mediation ]({app:urls:route:professional_mediation}) or a [Separated Parents Information Programme (SPIP)](https://www.cafcass.gov.uk/grown-ups/separated-parents-information-programme-%28spip%29.aspx).\r\n\r\nYour case may be put on hold (adjourned) if the judge needs more time to decide what’s best for the children. The court may ask Cafcass to write another report.\r\n\r\nA new date is then set for a final hearing. If you reach an agreement before this date the judge can stop the process.\r\n\r\nGOV.UK has more information on [what happens if there’s no agreement at the first hearing](https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/after-you-apply-for-a-court-order).",
