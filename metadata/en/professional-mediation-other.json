  "body": "### Shuttle mediation\r\n\r\nYour mediator may suggest you and the other parent sit in separate rooms and the mediator ‘shuttle’ between you. This is a good option if you’d prefer not to meet the other parent face-to-face or don’t feel safe to do so.\r\n\r\nShuttle mediation is usually more expensive than standard mediation because it’s a longer process.\r\n\r\n### Lawyer-assisted mediation\r\n\r\nThis is different to standard mediation because you and the other parent both hire lawyers who attend the sessions with you. You can also hire lawyers to help with shuttle mediation.\r\n\r\nAs mediators can’t offer legal advice you may want to choose this option if you have a lot of complex legal issues to resolve.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to consider the additional cost of a lawyer if you select this option.\r\n\r\n### Family mediation\r\n\r\nParents with children over 10 years old are encouraged to include them in the process so the mediator can hear their opinion.\r\n\r\nTalk with a mediator about whether it’s suitable to involve your children in your situation and ask your child if they’re happy to take part.\r\n\r\nCheck if your mediator is qualified to offer this service before booking.",
