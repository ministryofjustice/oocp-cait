  "body": "### Shuttle mediation\r\n\r\nYour mediator may suggest that you and the other parent sit in separate rooms while the mediator ‘shuttles’ between you. This is a good option if you’d prefer not to meet the other parent face-to-face or don’t feel safe to do so.\r\n\r\nShuttle mediation is usually more expensive than standard mediation because it’s a longer process.\r\n\r\n### Lawyer-assisted mediation\r\n\r\nThis is different to standard mediation because you and the other parent can both hire lawyers who attend sessions with you. Your lawyers can also help with shuttle mediation.\r\n\r\nAs mediators can’t offer legal advice you may want to choose this option if you have a lot of complex legal issues to resolve.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to consider the additional cost of a lawyer if you select this option.\r\n\r\n### Child-inclusive mediation\r\n\r\nIf your children understand your situation you can ask them to attend so a mediator can hear their wishes.\r\n \r\nTalk with a mediator first about whether it’s suitable to involve your children and remember to check if your children are happy to take part.\r\n \r\nYou’ll need to make sure your mediator is qualified to offer this service before booking.",
