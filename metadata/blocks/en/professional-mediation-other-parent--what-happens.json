  "body": "If you go to mediation, you’ll find out what the other parent wants to talk about. You’ll get the opportunity to talk about the situation from your point of view too. You don’t have to see the other parent if you don’t want to (you can be in separate rooms), and the mediator can arrange for you to arrive at different times.\r\n\r\nThe mediator will be independent, even if they operate from a solicitor’s office, and won’t take sides. They’ll support you both.\r\n\r\nWhatever you say in mediation is confidential. Information won’t be shared with anyone else without your permission (unless for example, there’s a safeguarding risk or a criminal offence is disclosed).\r\n\r\nYou and your ex will be able to raise things that are important to you and the mediator can help create a list of topics to talk through.\r\n\r\nMediation can help you stay in control. It’s voluntary and no-one will make you do anything against your wishes.\r\n\r\nThe mediator will help you and the other parent (separately or together) go through all your issues, think of your options, decide whether they would work well in practice and come to an agreement about what's best. They can also explain how you can make your agreement legally binding, if you want to.",
