The mediator can help you check.\r\n\r\nFirst you have a MIAM, which is the first meeting. The other parent sees the mediator too. You can have your MIAM on your own with the mediator so you can talk about any concerns you have.\r\n\r\nIf you continue with mediation, it usually takes place with the other parent over several sessions. You can be in separate rooms if you prefer. Each session lasts about 90 minutes.",
