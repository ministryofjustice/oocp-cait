The other parent is also expected to attend.\r\n\r\nAt either meeting the mediator will explain:\r\n\r\n- how mediation works\r\n- the benefits\r\n- whether it’s right for you\r\n- the likely costs\r\n- if you’re eligible for free mediation through [legal aid](https://checklegalaid.service.gov.uk/)\r\n\r\nOnly authorised mediators can carry out a MIAM.
