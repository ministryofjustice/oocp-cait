You’ll need to explain your issues and the outcome you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving instructions from you, your lawyer will begin negotiations with the other parent or their lawyer. You won’t have to deal directly with the other parent at any time.\r\n\r\nAs in [collaborative law]({app:urls:route:collaborative_law}) both lawyers will try and keep the case from going to court.\r\n\r\nIf your lawyers reach an agreement that you and the other parent are happy with they'll write down the details. If you both want to make the agreement legally binding they’ll submit it to court for consideration and approval.",
