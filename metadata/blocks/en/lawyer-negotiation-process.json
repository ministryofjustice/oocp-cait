  "body": "You might use lawyer negotiation (also known as solicitor-led negotiation) if you no longer talk to the other parent.\r\n\r\nTo begin the process both you and the other parent will need to hire your own lawyer.\r\n\r\nYour lawyer will set up a meeting to discuss the case with you. You’ll need to explain what your issues are and the outcome you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving instructions from you and the other parent, the lawyers will begin negotiations face-to-face. You won’t have to deal directly with the other parent at any time.\r\n\r\nAs in [collaborative law]({app:urls:route:collaborative_law}) both lawyers will try and keep the case from going to court.\r\n\r\nYour lawyers will draw up a document for court approval once they reach an agreement that you and the other parent are happy with.They’ll then submit it to the court for consideration and approval.",
