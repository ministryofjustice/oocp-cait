The document isn’t legally binding but both you and the other parent will need to sign it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make the document legally binding you can ask your lawyers to draft a [consent order](https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/if-you-agree). This isn’t usually necessary but ask your lawyer for advice.\r\n\r\n### If there’s no agreement at the first meeting\r\n\r\nYou and the other parent must meet with your lawyers to discuss the unresolved issues. A date is then set for a second meeting.\r\n\r\n### If there’s still no agreement\r\n\r\nIf it looks like you won’t be able to reach an agreement, you and the other parent may need to consider [going to court]({app:urls:route:going_to_court}).",
